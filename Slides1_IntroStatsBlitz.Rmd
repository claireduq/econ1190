# Syllabus and course logistics

## Course description

- hands-on skills in applied econometric research methods

- focus on research design and approaches to establish empirical relationships of cause and effect

- advanced methods in regression analysis


Topics covered include:

- omitted variable bias, fixed effects, instrumental variables, randomized control trials, difference-and-differences, and regression discontinuities. 

-  learning the basic tools of programming and coding in R (no prior knowledge is required)

- learn to present results in nice formatted tables and figures

## Is this course right for me? 

- I am interested in how economists do research with data

- I am interested in developing my (highly marketable!) data analysis skills

- I have taken a class such as ECON 1150: Applied Econometrics 1 (or STAT 1221, IF 1071) and am comfortable with:

  - basic probability and statistics
  - basic linear regressions
  
- to use other classes as prerequisites, check with Katherine Wolfe (kwolfeATpitt.edu) 

- I am ready to work hard!

# Review Blitz: Probability, Statistics and regressions 


## Review: Probability 

The probability of event A ($P(A)$) is a number between 0 and 1:
$$
0 \leq P(A) \leq 1
$$
Conditional Probability

The probability of an an event might change when additional information becomes available

$$
P(A|B)=\text{probability of A given that B occured}
$$
Statistical Independence

Two events are statistically independent if the information that one of them has happened does not change the probability of the other

$$
\text{A and B are independent if } P(A|B)=P(A)
$$


## Stats Review: Random Variables

Random variables:

a variable that whose value depends on random events

For a given outcome $x$ we may be interested in the probability that the variable $X$ achieves that outcome 

$$
P(X=x)=?
$$
These outcomes could be discreet or continuous

## Stats Review: Discreet random variables

Discreet random variables take a finite number of values

There is a probability associated with each of it's possible values

$$
\sum_{allx} P(X=x)=1
$$


## Stats Review: Continuous random variables

Continuous random variables take an infinite number of possible values

The density function gives the probability that a random variable is smaller than some value so that

$$
P(X\leq a)= \int_{-\infty}^{a} f(x) dx
$$
with 
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) dx=1
$$

A cumulative density function maps out $$F(a)=P(X\leq a) $$

## Stats Review: Summarizing random variables

Measures of location:

- mean:
$$
\text{Discreet: } E[X]=\mu_X=\sum_{allx}xP(X=x)
$$

$$
\text{ Continuous: } E[X]=\mu_X=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} xf(x) dx
$$

- Also median,  percentiles (ex: quartiles) ...

## Stats Review: Summarizing random variables

Measures of dispersion:

- Variance
$$
\text{Discreet: } Var(X)=\sigma^2_X=\sum_{allx}(x-\mu_X)^2P(X=x)
$$

$$
\text{ Continuous: } Var(X)=\sigma^2_X=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (x-\mu_X)^2f(x) dx
$$

- Standard deviation: $$ Std.Dev.(X)=\sigma_x=\sqrt{\sigma^2_X}$$


## Stats Review: Important distributions

\textbf{Uniform:} the same probability to all values of the random variable

\textbf{Normal:} Important mainly because of the central limit theorem

\textbf{Standard normal:} A normal with mean 0 and standard deviation 1

## Stats Review: Sampling, estimation and inference

## Stats Review: Sampling, estimation and inference

What information do we get from the sample? 

Get the sample mean $$\bar{X}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n}$$ 


If you collected a new random sample, your sample mean will be different: $$\bar{X}_1 \neq \bar{X}_2\neq \bar{X}_3\neq \bar{X}_4 ...$$

So what can we learn from the SAMPLE mean about the POPULATION mean $\mu$ (what we really care about)?

## Stats Review: The Central Limit Theorem

Consider a random sample of $n$ observations taken from a population $X$
with expected value $\mu_X$ and standard deviation $\sigma_X$. The following are always true of the sample mean $\bar{X}.$

- The probability distribution of $\bar{X}$ approaches a normal distribution as $n$ increases (i.e. with bigger sample size, the distribution of possible $\bar{X}_i$'s looks like a bell curve)

- The expected value of $\bar{X}$ equal $\mu_X$ (i.e this bell curve is centered on the population mean)

- The standard deviation of $\bar{X}$ (aka the \textbf{standard error}) equals $\frac{\sigma_X}{\sqrt{n}}$ (i.e. the bell curve is tighter as the sample size increases)



## Stats Review: Standard errors and confidence intervals

So given our sample, our best guess of the population mean is the sample mean
$$E[\mu_X]=\bar{X}$$
How good is this guess? How far away from the population mean from the sample mean?

- We build confidence intervals around $\bar{X}$ with its standard error  $SE_{\bar{X}}$ 

- To do this we use a critical value, often 1.96($\approx2$), that reflects how certain we want to be that the confidence interval includes the population mean.

## Stats Review: Hypothesis testing

Using these confidence intervals, we can REJECT or FAIL TO REJECT a Null Hypothesis.

- Reject the Null Hypothesis if there is ``enough'' evidence against it

\textbf{p-value}: The largest probability of observing sample data as extreme as your draw given that the Null is true
