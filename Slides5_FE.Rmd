- Example: Crime and Unemployment

## Controlling for unobservables

We saw with AGG(2006) that even with many covariates, unobservables are a problem. 

Certain types of data allow us to control for more of these unobservables by using fixed effects.

## Example:

$$
Income_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 Schooling_i+\epsilon
$$

$\beta_1$ cannot be interpreted as causal: big OVB problems, even with lots of control variables. Unlikely to have good measures of 'ability', 'enthusiasm', 'grit'...

What if I can control for unchanging individual characteristics?

## Data Structures: Cross-Section


|Individual    |Income      |Schooling   |Female    |
|--------------|------------|------------|----------|
|1	           |22000       |12          |1         |
|2	           |57000       |16          |1         |
|...	         |...         |...         |...       |
|N	           |15000       |12          |0         |

Each individual is observed once.

## Data Structures: Panel Data


|Individual    |Income      |Schooling   |Female  |Year   |
|--------------|------------|------------|--------|-------|
|1	           |22000       |12          |1       |2001   |
|1	           |23000       |12          |1       |2002   |
|2	           |57000       |16          |1       |2001   |
|2	           |63000       |17          |1       |2002   |
|...	         |...         |...         |...     |...    |
|N	           |15000       |12          |0       |2001   |
|N	           |13000       |12          |0       |2002   |

Each individual is observed multiple times. 


## Data Structures: Panel Data Subscripts

Unique observations must be identified by both the individual and time dimensions... notice the new subscripts: 

$$
Income_{it}=\beta_0+\beta_1 Schooling_{it}+\epsilon.
$$

## Data Structures: Panel Data

Panel Data can be

- **balanced**: same number of observations for each unit 

- **unbalanced**: some units are observed more often then others (probably good to look into why)

## Review: Indicator (Dummy) Variables

If I have multiple Female observation and multiple non-female observations I can control for the effect of being female on wages.  

If I have multiple Married observation and multiple non-married observations I can control for the effect of being married on wages.  


$$
Income_{it}=\beta_0+\beta_1 Schooling_{it}+\beta_2Female_i+ \beta_3 Married_{it}+\epsilon.
$$

## Fixed Effects as Individual Indicator Variables

\tiny

|Indiv|Income |School |Female |Married |Year   |Indiv1   |Indiv2|...    |IndivN|

## Fixed Effects as Individual Indicator Variables

I can estimate:
\footnotesize
$$
Inc_{it}=\beta_0+\beta_1Sch_{it}+\beta_2Fem_i+\beta_3 Mar_{it}+\beta_{a1}Ind1_i+\beta_{a2}Ind2_i+...+\beta_{aN-1}Ind(N-1)_i+\epsilon.
$$
\normalsize
What do the $\beta_{ak}$ coefficients tell me?

\bigskip
Also: 

- Why do the $IndN$ indicators only have an $i$ subscript?

- What is the implied assumption if $Fem$ only has an $i$ subscript?

- Why are there only (N-1) individual dummies? 

- Will I be able to estimate the $\beta_2$ on $Fem_i$?

- Will I be able to estimate the $\beta_3$ on $Mar_{it}$?

## Fixed Effects as Individual Indicator Variables


**What will these individual controls control for?**


## Fixed Effects as Individual Indicator Variables


**What will these individual controls control for?**

- $\beta_{a1}$ will control for the effect of being individual 1 on income that is not explained by that person's marital status or schooling.

- Any **time invariant** characteristic that affects individual 1's income, such as ability, grit, enthusiasm... will be controlled for by adding this individual dummy variable. 

- These controls are known as individual **fixed effects**.

**For notational convenience:** 

$$
Income_{it}=\beta_0+\beta_1Schooling_{it}+\beta_2Married_{it}+\gamma_i+\epsilon.
$$

## Fixed Effects 

**With my panel data, what else can I control for?**


$$
Income_{it}=\beta_0+\beta_1Schooling_{it}+\beta_2 Married_{it}+\gamma_i+\lambda_t+\epsilon.
$$

- What is $\lambda_t$?

- What is this estimation equivalent to?

## Fixed Effects and variation:

If I estimate 

$$
Income_{it}=\beta_0+\beta_1Schooling_{it}+\beta_2 Married_{it}+\gamma_i+\lambda_t+\epsilon.
$$
Where (who?) is my identifying variation coming from for estimating $\beta_1$?

Does this matter? How does it change our interpretation of the estimate?


## A Simulation:

You are a principle of a small school composed of four classrooms. You have just implemented a new option available to teachers for students to spend some small group reading time with a para-educator. You would like to know how this reading time is affecting reading scores. 

\bigskip
**You have data for ten students in each class that tells you:**

- the class the student is in

- whether they participated in small group reading

- their reading score. 

## Generating Simulated Data


I will work with a simulated dataset to show how the use of fixed effects can help us recover the true treatment effect. 

I start by loading the dplyr package and "setting the seed": 

\tiny
```{r simfe, echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#install.packages("dplyr")
#install.packages("lfe")
#install.packages("stargazer")

library(dplyr)
library(lfe)
library(stargazer)
library(fastDummies)

set.seed(1999)

```

## A Simulation: 

I generate a vector of class identifiers and a random error term.

\tiny
```{r simfe1a, results = "asis", echo = TRUE}



class<-c(1,2,3,4)
class<-rep(class, each=10)
scores<-as.data.frame(class)
scores$error<-rnorm(40, mean=0, sd=5)

#note: if you are not working in markdown you would just write head(scores)
knitr::kable(head(scores))
```


## A Simulation: 

I simulate some selection into treatment. The probability of getting treated is 

- 0.8 for students in classrooms 3 and 4 

- 0.2 in classrooms 1 and 2. 

\tiny
```{r simfe2, results = "asis", echo = TRUE}
scores$treat1<-rbinom(40,1,0.2)
scores$treat2<-rbinom(40,1,0.8)
scores$treat[scores$class%in%c(1,2)]<-scores$treat1[scores$class%in%c(1,2)]
scores$treat[scores$class%in%c(3,4)]<-scores$treat2[scores$class%in%c(3,4)]

knitr::kable(head(scores))
```

## A Simulation:

I drop unneeded variables and generate a dummy variable for each classroom

\tiny
```{r simfe3, results = "asis", echo = TRUE}

scores<-scores%>%select(class,error,treat)
scores <- dummy_cols(scores, select_columns = "class")

knitr::kable(head(scores))
```

## A Simulation:


Finally! I simulate the DGP (Data Generating Process):

- The true treatment effect = 15

- students in classrooms 1 and 2 have higher reading scores  

- students in classrooms 3 and 4 have lower reading scores. 

\tiny
```{r simfe4, results = "asis", echo = TRUE}

scores$classFE<-NA
scores$classFE[scores$class_1==1]<-0
scores$classFE[scores$class_2==1]<-10
scores$classFE[scores$class_3==1]<-(-30)
scores$classFE[scores$class_4==1]<-(-35)


scores$score<-80+15*scores$treat+scores$classFE+scores$error

knitr::kable(head(scores))

```



## A Simulation:

I estimate three specifications. The first: 

$$
Score_{ci}=\beta_0+\beta_1 Treat_{ci}+\epsilon
$$
\bigskip

```{r simfe5a, results = "asis",echo = TRUE}

nofe<-felm(score~treat,scores)

```


## A Simulation:

The second: 

$$
Score_{ci}=\beta_0+\beta_1Treat_{ci}+\beta_2Class2_c+\beta_3Class3_c+\beta_4Class4_c+\epsilon
$$
\bigskip

```{r simfe5b, results = "asis", echo = TRUE}

dummies<-felm(score~treat+class_2+class_3+class_4, scores)

```


## A Simulation:

The third: 
$$
Score_{ci}=\beta_0+\beta_1Treat_{ci}+\kappa_c+\epsilon
$$
where $\kappa_c$ is a classroom fixed effect.
\bigskip


```{r simfe5c, results = "asis",echo = TRUE}

fe<-felm(score~treat|class,scores)

```

## A Simulation:

\tiny
```{r simfe5d, results = "asis",echo = TRUE}

stargazer(nofe, dummies, fe,header=FALSE, type='latex')


```

## A Simulation:

Recall:  $\beta_1=15$ (the true treatment effect) $\Rightarrow$ $\hat{\beta}_1^{nofe}$ is very biased! 

**Why?**

$\Rightarrow$ Top Hat 

## A Simulation:

Recall:  $\beta_1=15$ (the true treatment effect) $\Rightarrow$ $\hat{\beta}_1^{nofe}$ is very biased! 

**Why?**

- The classes are an important omitted variable: $cor(Score,Class3/4)<0$ and $cor(Treat,Class3/4)>0$ creating substantial downward bias. 

We can correct for this in two (equivalent) ways: 

- adding the dummy variables for the class to the regression,

- adding a class fixed effect. 

Either approach returns an identical unbiased estimate such that $E[\hat{\beta}_1]=\beta_1$.

## Fixed Effects as Demeaned Data: 

 Fixed effect estimates are also known as the **within estimator**, because it identifies $\beta$ using within-unit variation.
 
 $\Rightarrow$ we only using the  variation that exists __within the classroom__ to estimate the treatment effect.
 
This is the equivalent of "correcting" our data by demeaning each observation using it's classroom mean, so that the corrected data represents deviations from the classroom mean.

## Fixed Effects as Demeaned Data: 

Our fixed effect estimation is 

$$
y_{ci}=\beta_1x_{ci}+\kappa_c+\epsilon_{ci}
$$
For each class, the average across the students is

$$
\bar{y}_i=\beta_1\bar{x}_i+\kappa_c+\bar{\epsilon}_i
$$
Subtracting this from the fixed effect model gives
$$
y_{ic}-\bar{y}_i=\beta_1(x_{ic}-\bar{x}_i)+(\epsilon_{ic}-\bar{\epsilon}_i)
$$


## Fixed Effects as Demeaned Data: 

1. Calculate the mean score, and the mean treatment, in each classroom

\tiny
```{r simfe6a, results = "asis",echo = TRUE}

#getting the mean score in each classroom
cl_mean<-scores %>%
    group_by(class) %>%
    summarize(Classmean = mean(score, na.rm=TRUE), treatmean=mean(treat, na.rm=TRUE))

knitr::kable(head(cl_mean))
```

## Fixed Effects as Demeaned Data: 

2. Merging the means into full data

\tiny
```{r simfe6b, results = "asis",echo = TRUE}

scores<-left_join(scores, cl_mean, by = "class")

knitr::kable(head(scores))

```


## Fixed Effects as Demeaned Data: 

3. Calculating the demeaned score

\tiny
```{r simfe6c, results = "asis",echo = TRUE}

scores$demeansc<-scores$score-scores$Classmean
scores$demeantrt<-scores$treat-scores$treatmean

knitr::kable(head(scores[,c("class","treat","score","Classmean","treatmean","demeansc","demeantrt")]))

```


## Fixed Effects as Demeaned Data: 

4. Running the basic regression on the demeaned scores

\tiny
```{r simfe6d, results = "asis",echo = TRUE}

regdemean<-felm(demeansc~demeantrt, scores)
stargazer( fe, regdemean,header=FALSE, type='latex', omit.stat=c("all" ))

```

Careful:  the standard errors on the demeaned regression are incorrect because the cases are not independent of each other.

## Variation

What would happen if none of the students in classes 1 and 2 went to the small reading group and all of the students in class 3 and 4 did?

## Variation

Creating a new treatment variable to reflect this: 

\tiny
```{r simfenovar, results = "asis",echo = TRUE}

scores$treat2[scores$class%in%c(1,2)]<-0
scores$treat2[scores$class%in%c(3,4)]<-1

scores$score2<-80+15*scores$treat2+scores$classFE+scores$error

nofe2<-felm(score2~treat2,scores)
dummies2<-felm(score2~treat2+class_2+class_3+class_4, scores)
#fe2<-felm(score2~treat2|class,scores)
```

## Variation

\tiny
```{r simfenovar2, results = "asis",echo = TRUE}

stargazer(nofe2, dummies2, header=FALSE,  type='latex')
```



## Example: Crime and Unemployment

You are interested in the relationship between unemployment and crime. 

You have data on the crime and unemployment rates for 46 cities for 1982 and 1987. 

I start by using the data from the 1987 cross section and run the following simple regression of the crime rate on unemployment,

$$
crimerate_i=\beta_0+\beta_1unemployment_i+\epsilon
$$


## Example: Crime and Unemployment

\tiny
```{r crime,echo = TRUE}
#install.packages("wooldridge")
library(wooldridge)

#note: this dataset comes from the wooldridge textbook. Conveniently there is an R package that 
#includes all the wooldridge datasets. 

crime<-data('crime2')
crime<-crime2

```


## Example: Crime and Unemployment

\tiny
```{r crime2,echo = TRUE}

regcrime<-felm(crmrte~unem, crime[crime$year=="87",])
summary(regcrime)

```


## Example: Crime and Unemployment

Weird. 

The culprit? Probably omitted variables. 

Reflex: lets add controls for more observable city characteristics: the area of the city, if the city is in the west, police officers per square mile, expenditure on law enforcement, per capita income... 

\small
$$
crmrte_i=\beta_0+\beta_1unemp_i+\beta_2area_i+\beta_3west_i+\beta_4offarea_i+\beta_5lawexp_i+\beta_6pcinc_i+\epsilon
$$

## Example: Crime and Unemployment

\tiny
```{r crime2a,echo = TRUE}

regcrime2<-felm(crmrte~unem+area+west+offarea+lawexpc+pcinc, crime[crime$year=="87",])
summary(regcrime2)

```


## Example: Crime and Unemployment

Even weirder. 

So many potential omitted variables... 

What if we can **capture all unobserved, time invariant factors** about a city that might affect crime rates?

Use data for 1987 and 1982, and add city **fixed effects,**($\alpha_i$).

\small
$$
\begin{aligned}
crmrte_{it}=&\beta_0+\beta_1unemp_{it}\\
&+\beta_2area_i+\beta_3west_i+\beta_4offarea_{it}+\beta_5lawexp_{it}+\beta_6pcinc_{it}\\
&+\alpha_i+\epsilon
\end{aligned}
$$


## Example: Crime and Unemployment

\tiny
```{r crime3, echo = TRUE}
#note: the data does not have a unique city identifier. I am assuming the area of the city is 
#1)time-invariant and 
#2) uniquely identifies the 46 cities. 
#The line of code below generates a unique identifier

crime <- transform(crime,city=as.numeric(factor(area)))

#I check that my assumptions were correct by seeing if I have 2 observations for 46 cities.
table(crime$city)
```

## Example: Crime and Unemployment

\tiny
```{r crime3a,echo = TRUE}
regcrime3<-felm(crmrte~unem+area+west+offarea+lawexpc+pcinc|city, crime)
summary(regcrime3)

```


## Example: Crime and Unemployment

Interpret the coefficient on unemployment.

Why were we not able to estimate a coefficient for $area_i$ and $west_i$?

$\Rightarrow$ Top Hat 




## Example: Crime and Unemployment

Suppose I am concerned about how national factors could be affecting all cities simultaneously. 

Add a year fixed effect, ($\lambda_t$).

$$
\begin{aligned}
crmrte_{it}=&\beta_0+\beta_1unemp_{it}\\
&+\beta_2area_i+\beta_3west_i+\beta_4offarea_{it}+\beta_5lawexp_{it}+\beta_6pcinc_{it}\\
&+\alpha_i+\lambda_t+\epsilon
\end{aligned}
$$

## Example: Crime and Unemployment

\tiny
```{r crime4,echo = TRUE}

regcrime4<-felm(crmrte~unem+area+west+offarea+lawexpc+pcinc|city+year, crime)
summary(regcrime4)

```

## Example: Crime and Unemployment

Is this estimate causal? 

$\Rightarrow$ Top Hat 


## Example: Crime and Unemployment

Is this estimate causal? 

What we have controlled for?

- The city fixed effects:  controls for any time invariant factors that always affect the crime rates in a city in a similar way. Such as...

- The time fixed effects: controls for any patterns that are common to all cities in a given year. Such as...

- In addition to this we are also controlling for some observable time varying variables: officers in an area, law enforcement expenditures per capita and income per capita.

So are these estimates causal? 

What kind of omitted variables should we still be concerned about? $\Rightarrow$ Top Hat 

## Example: Crime and Unemployment

Any variable that changes within a city across years and that is correlated with both unemployment and crime rates could still be biasing our results.

This could be things like school funding, decriminalization of marijuana, housing costs... to name just a few.

## Example: Crime and Unemployment Variation


Suppose I get ambitious and want to control for all these factors as well. 

I decide I am going to generate a city-by-year fixed effect, ($\gamma_{it}$),  to control for these time variant omitted variables. I estimate,  



$$
\begin{aligned}
crmrte_{it}=&\beta_0+\beta_1unemp_{it}\\
&+\beta_2area_i+\beta_3west_i+\beta_4offarea_{it}+\beta_5lawexp_{it}+\beta_6pcinc_{it}\\
&+\gamma_{it}+\epsilon
\end{aligned}
$$


## Example: Crime and Unemployment Variation

\tiny
```{r crime5,echo = TRUE}

crime$city_year<-paste(crime$city, crime$year, sep="_")

#Note: the following regression will not run!
#regcrime5<-felm(crmrte~unem+area+west+offarea+lawexpc+pcinc|city_year, crime)
#summary(regcrime5)

```
\normalsize

Why?!?

What kind of data would I need to be able to estimate this?
